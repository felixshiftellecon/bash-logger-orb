  This orb adds a command to log bash commands and outputs of those commands in steps.
  Note: This only works with steps that are Bash commands.
  It will not work with CircleCI commands.
  To use this with orbs, it will need to be baked into the orb itself rather that called from the project's config.
# What will your orb allow users to accomplish?
# Descriptions should be short, simple, and informative.

# This information will be displayed in the orb registry and is not mandatory.

# If your orb requires other orbs, you can import them like this. Otherwise remove the "orbs" stanza.

#  hello: circleci/hello-build@0.0.5
