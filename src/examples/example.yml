  Example of how to log and store the command and output of bash steps.
  Note: This only works with steps that are Bash commands.
  It will not work with CircleCI commands.
  To use this with orbs, it will need to be baked into the orb itself
  rather that called from the project's config.
# Provide a use-case based example for using this orb.
# Everything in the `usage` section will be displayed in the orb registry.
# Comments are not retained.
